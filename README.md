## cstring

<p align="justify">
cstring is a thread safe C library that allows a user to build and manipulate strings in a similar fashion to high level programming languages like Java and Python. Memory is automatically managed by the library, requiring no manual allocation or deallocation of memory by the user. Nonetheless, all parts of a string structure are accessible to the user and can be safely modified, resized, and deallocated using the given library functions. The libary has built in input checking and will exit the program if any input to the a libary funciton is beyond its tolerance and an error message will be displayed. Please look over the function declarations to understand the functionality of the library.
