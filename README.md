## cstring

<p align="justify">
cstring is a thread safe C library that allows programmers to build and modify strings in a similar fashion to higher level programming languages such as Python and Java. Memory is dynamically allocated at runtime and automatically freed on exit, requiring no manual allocation or deallocation of memory by the user for strings they create. Nonetheless, all attributes of cstring instances are accesible to the programmer and can be safely modified and deallocated using the appropriate library functions. Programmers also have support from the library's build in input checking which is able to catch fatal errors related to cstring before they happen and help simplify the debugging process.<br><br>Please look over the function declarations to understand the functionality of the library functions.
