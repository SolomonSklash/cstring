## CSTRING

<p align="justify">
CSTRING is a thread safe C library that allows developers to build and modify strings in a similar fashion to higher level programming languages such as Python and Java. Memory is dynamically allocated at runtime and freed on exit automatically, requiring no manual allocation or deallocation of memory by the user. Nonetheless, all members of each string structure are accessible to the programmer and can be safely modified and deallocated using the given library functions. Programmers also have support from the library's built in input checking which is able to catch fatal errors related to cstring before they happen and simplify debugging.
