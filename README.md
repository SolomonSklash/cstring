## cstring

<p align="justify">
cstring is a thread safe C library that allows programmers to build and manipulate strings in a similar fashion to high level programming languages such as Java and Python. Memory is dynamically allocated at runtime and freed on exit automatically, requiring no manual allocation or deallocation of memory by the user.<br><br>Nonetheless, all members of the string structure are accessible to the user and can be safely modified and deallocated using the given library functions. The library has built in input checking to be able to catch fatal errors before they happen and simplify debugging.<br><br>Please look over the function declarations to understand the functionality of the library functions.
